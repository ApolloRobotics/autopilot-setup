# TODOs

#### TODO for prod (high-priority): 
- Create our own systemd service. Wait for network manager, preferably run last, and prevent boot until complete so that the status appears on screen via HDMI. Or even better create a service that reports back to host when setup is complete.
- Setup PM2 

#### TODO for dev env (low-priority):
- Fix wallpaper being set.
- Fix sleep time not being set.
- Remove locked launcher shortcuts.
- Add our launcher shortcuts.
- Don't auto-install sh-env-setup, make the dev dependencies an option.
- Fix ROS alias shortcuts.
